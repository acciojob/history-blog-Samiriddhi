	<p>An early example of a "diary" style blog consisting of text and images transmitted wirelessly in real-time<br> from a wearable computer with head-up display, February 22, 1995 The term "weblog" was coined by Jorn<br> Barger[13] on December 17, 1997. The short form, "blog", was coined by Peter Merholz, who jokingly broke<br> the word weblog into the phrase we blog in the sidebar of his blog Peterme.com in April or May 1999.[14]<br>[15][16] Shortly thereafter, Evan Williams at Pyra Labs used "blog" as both a noun and verb ("to blog",<br> meaning "to edit one''s weblog or to post to one''s weblog") and devised the term "blogger" in connection <br>with Pyra Labs'' Blogger product, leading to the popularization of the terms.[17]</p>
